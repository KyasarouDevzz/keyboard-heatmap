# KBM Heatmap

## Silly lil' project

This is a fun and simple project that tracks keyboard and mouse usage to create heatmaps. See which keys you press the most and where you put your mouse in GAMING :FIRE:

### Features
- **Keyboard Heatmap**: Visualize your most-used keys.
- **Mouse Heatmap**: See a map of your mouse movements and clicks.

### How It Works
The project logs key presses (excluding the spacebar) and mouse activity, then generates heatmaps to show your usage patterns.

### Usage
1. **Run the script**: The program will start logging your keyboard and mouse activity.
2. **Stop logging**: Press `F5` to stop and generate the heatmaps.
3. **View the heatmaps**: Enjoy the visual representation of your keyboard and mouse usage!
